# `@avenos/document-ingest`

Turn invoices and account statements into reusable facts, rank matching bookings, and
record a person's confirmation with exact evidence. The same skill implementations
run on the device and remote Actor Runner through the general observation solver.
Matching is automatic; accepting a relationship remains an explicit human action,
not an allocation of money or a payment.

For the complete desktop-to-server architecture, execution sequences, persistence
boundaries, and source map, see
[`docs/document-ingest-system.md`](../../docs/document-ingest-system.md).

The package owns:

- document source, page, classification, finance, and validation contracts;
- deterministic and model-backed actor manifests and procedures;
- prompts and structured-output schemas;
- capability-based document-model selection;
- placement-frozen local/server host contracts; and
- document and reconciliation skill bindings, stable publication identities,
  committed-output replay, and processing projections.

It depends on the portable actor, Artifact Store, and LLM contracts plus PDF.js for
the headless deterministic decoder. It does not import Svelte, Tauri, or browser APIs.
Consequently the actor definitions run in the desktop app and the Actor Runner. The
`DocumentProcessingRuntime` supplies execution, publication and presentation adapters.
`src/skill.ts` contributes requirements, observed outputs, sealed page/batch gathers,
Actor payload bindings and retry policy. The domain-neutral scheduler in
`@avenos/actors` selects the next ready invocation from committed observations, rather
than assuming that advertised outputs already exist. Adding a branch changes the
skill contribution, not the scheduler.

`src/reconciliation-flow.ts` contributes scoped retrieval, amount-first shortlisting,
ranking and review preparation to the same solver. Its separate decision operation
requires explicit effect admission. A scope-wide publication watermark freezes
pagination; the ranker receives at most 64 transaction occurrences per invoice and
reports truncation. Provider-ID conflict groups remain intact. Fingerprint-only rows
are separate observations, not silently collapsed transactions.

## Actor inventory

Every built-in actor owns one directory under `src/actors`. The directory name is the
actor manifest ID, so listing that directory is the authoritative at-a-glance catalog:

| Actor directory | Method | Lane |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `document-inspector/` | `document_inspect` | Deterministic |
| `document-decomposer/` | `document_decompose` | Deterministic |
| `native-text-extractor/` | `document_extract_native_text` | Deterministic |
| `page-signal-classifier/` | `document_classify_page` | Deterministic |
| `document-assembler/` | `document_assemble` | Deterministic |
| `content-aggregator/` | `document_aggregate_content` | Deterministic |
| `visual-page-analyzer/` | `document_analyze_page` | Vision for rendered pages; deterministic for text |
| `document-kind-classifier/` | `document_classify_kind` | Vision model |
| `csv-statement-detector/` | `document_detect_csv_statement` | Deterministic, strict profiles |
| `csv-statement-mapper/` | `document_map_csv_statement` | Deterministic, explicit reusable column mapping |
| `csv-statement-admitter/` | `document_admit_csv_statement` | Deterministic, requires human document confirmation |
| `invoice-extractor/` | `document_extract_invoice` | Vision model |
| `statement-extractor/` | `document_extract_statement` | Vision model |
| `invoice-validator/` | `document_validate_invoice` | Deterministic |
| `statement-validator/` | `document_validate_statement` | Deterministic |
| `open-item-normalizer/` | `document_normalize_open_item` | Deterministic |
| `statement-normalizer/` | `document_normalize_statement` | Deterministic |
| `statement-transaction-fanout/` | `document_fanout_statement_transactions` | Deterministic |
| `reconciliation-ranker/` | `reconciliation_rank_invoice_transactions` | Deterministic |
| `document-merger/` | `document_merge_kinds`, `document_merge_invoice`, `document_merge_statement` | Deterministic, combines chunk results |

Each directory exports its release-owned manifest as data and a named factory. The
`DOCUMENT_ACTOR_MANIFESTS` list under `actors/registry` includes 20 Actors with 22 methods,
including model-backed methods when no model host is currently available. Listing it
does not construct Actors or call a decoder/model. A conformance test compares these
exports with the actual constructed manifests. The runner's document runtime supplies
the generic Studio installations: procedures, schemas, authorization and durable
publication. A manifest alone does not grant execution authority.
Factories can be imported directly, for example:

```ts
import { createDocumentInspectorActor } from '@avenos/document-ingest/actors/document-inspector'
```

`src/actors/registry.ts` is the composition root that constructs the standard graph.
`src/shared.ts` contains only cross-actor contracts and pure helpers; it contains no
actor implementation.

## Host adapters

CSV files do not enter model classification or financial extraction. `src/csv.ts`
recognizes a bounded set of exact export profiles and validates every row. Eligible
files stop at a mandatory document-type review; unrecognized or ambiguous files stay
blocked. `src/csv-confirmation.ts` records the physical human decision against the
exact source digest and detection revision. The solver observes this committed
confirmation before admitting a statement candidate to the normal validation,
normalization and matching path. Document confirmation never accepts an invoice match.
The [CSV specimens and limits](../../fixtures/golden/bank-csv/README.md) distinguish
formats that merely decode from those currently eligible for this human checkpoint.

For other account-statement layouts, `src/csv-mapping.ts` provides the Studio Actor
**Map CSV columns**. An agent can propose its named-column settings after reading the
headers and clarifying ambiguous conventions. The Actor, not the model, parses every
row and computes exact minor-unit amounts. UTF-8, Windows-1252 and UTF-16 LE/BE are
supported. Dates, decimal/group separators and debit/credit signs are explicit;
missing facts stay null. Every column must be mapped or acknowledged as ignored.
Changed headers, mixed currencies, malformed rows and inexact amounts reject the
whole file. Current bounds are 1 MiB, 64 columns and 128 transactions per file.

The output is a reviewable detection, not a confirmed statement. Its artifact preview
shows rows and a physical confirmation control. Approval is bound to that exact
mapping result, not just the source file; changing the mapping requires another
review. Source bytes and mapping parameters remain in provenance. The existing
admission, validation, normalization and transaction Actors handle the next stage.
Transaction fan-out requires an explicit zero-based offset and publishes at most
64 rows per call; larger statements need successive batches, not a silent prefix.
Confirmation is a separate human action, not an Actor that an agent can approve and
not an automatic pause/resume node. No workflow should claim otherwise.

A host supplies three concrete edges:

1. a `DocumentDecoder` for bounded PDF/image inspection and rendering;
2. an `LlmGatewayClient` for catalog discovery and completion; and
3. a `ClientArtifactGateway` for atomic output/provenance publication and committed-run
   lookup. Reconciliation additionally requires scoped typed queries and artifact reads.

The desktop implementations remain intentionally thin:

- `app/src/lib/artifacts/browser-document-decoder.ts` uses browser/PDF.js facilities;
- `app/src/lib/actors/document-llm-gateway.ts` binds the generic Tauri LLM client; and
- `app/src/lib/artifacts/client-document-processing.ts` registers actors and binds the
  Tauri Artifact Store command.

The server implementations are equally thin:

- `ServerDocumentDecoder` uses PDF.js plus headless canvas rendering and the same
  file, page, pixel, and rendered-byte limits as the browser adapter;
- both decoders collect native text through `readPdfTextContent`, using stream readers
  rather than assuming that the webview supports `ReadableStream` async iteration;
- `HttpLlmGatewayClient` reaches the facade's service-authenticated internal LLM
  contract; and
- `ArtifactStoreDocumentGateway` publishes through the Actor Runner's tenant-scoped
  Artifact Store route.

`tests/server-decoder.test.ts`, `tests/historical-capability-parity.test.ts`, and the
Actor Runner's `document-lane-conformance.test.ts` make client/server semantic parity
and the former server extractor's capability floor executable contracts.

The extended provider rail uses the same repository invoice and production
prompt/schema path. It is deliberately separate from deterministic conformance:

```sh
TEST_DOCUMENT_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.example/internal/v1/llm \
TEST_DOCUMENT_LLM_BEARER_TOKEN=... \
TEST_DOCUMENT_MODEL_ID=optional-model-id \
bun run --cwd libs/aven-document-ingest test:provider
```

`test:provider` requires the gateway URL and bearer and fails rather than skipping when
they are missing. The ordinary `test` command skips this external rail.

Artifact publication is wrapped in `QueuedClientArtifactGateway`. It serializes local
publications, retries only host-declared transient failures, and preserves the stable
`publicationId`, so backpressure cannot duplicate a committed production run.
The runtime checks that identity before invoking an Actor. Inspection publications
retain decoded pages in a JSON blob, so replay can restore the committed prefix
without repeating decoding or paid model calls. Failed attempts and in-flight local
progress are not a durable execution journal.

`DocumentExecutionRouter` chooses one `DocumentExecutionHost` per process. Device
placement uses the in-process host. Server placement uses `RemoteDocumentExecutionHost`
to submit the document skill through the authenticated Plan Runner facade. The
separate Actor Runner owns the customer-scoped SQL run ledger, reads and publishes
through tenant-routed Artifact Store access, and returns the durable presentation in
the run checkpoint. `src/server.ts` supplies its bounded text/PDF decoder, publication
adapter, and application executor. See
[`docs/actor-runtime-formal-spec.md`](../../docs/actor-runtime-formal-spec.md) for the
wire protocol and generic executor boundary.

The application imports these package subpaths directly; no application compatibility
re-export remains.

The production catalog installs both document ingestion and reconciliation. The
desktop uses the existing comparison/confirmation control without changing its
layout. Rejections are persisted and expose the next proposal. Decisions identify
the exact candidate, invoice occurrence and transaction occurrence; one immutable
decision per pair prevents retries from recording contradictory choices. Reversal,
partial-payment allocation, global assignment and automatic acceptance are not
implemented. The installed Actor catalog remains explicit; this does not claim
arbitrary third-party skill discovery or per-step distributed leases.

Text-only pages retain native text and UTF-8 layout offsets without a visual
transcription request. Document-kind classification can still use the model. Rendered
PDFs and images continue through vision, since embedded PDF text may disagree with
what is printed. File content aggregation preserves homogeneous page kinds, ignores
blank pages beside known content, reports mixed known content as `mixed`, and retains
`unknown` whenever a page remains unknown.
