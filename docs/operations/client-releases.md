# Client downloads

Status: authoritative

**Client installers** builds Linux DEB/AppImage packages, an Apple Silicon macOS
DMG, and an ARM64 Android APK. It attaches them to one GitHub prerelease, with
`SHA256SUMS` and a `client-release.json` manifest recording the source commit,
API origin, identity origin, sizes, and signing status. GitHub's automatically
generated source archives are not installers.

## Current signing limits

These are test downloads, not a signed production distribution. Linux packages
are unsigned. The Mac app is ad-hoc signed and not notarized; Gatekeeper may
block it. Android uses the build host's debug key. Do not distribute these builds
as production installers or replace a production installation with them.

An Android build made with another debug key cannot update an existing installation
signed by the previous key. Uninstalling that application deletes its local data.
Direct Android passkey authentication also requires the exact signing fingerprint in
identity's `ANDROID_APP_CERT_SHA256_FINGERPRINTS`. Do not add disposable debug
fingerprints to production identity; use browser/device-code sign-in for these tests.
Renaming a passkey on the identity dashboard changes its account label, not its
password-manager entry or signing identity.

Durable Android signing and a Developer ID Application certificate plus Apple
notarization are prerequisites for a future stable download workflow. Existing
App Store distribution certificates are not interchangeable with Developer ID.
Keep App Store/TestFlight uploads on their separate path. See
[Apple's distribution guidance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-distribution-signed-code-for-the-mac/)
and [Tauri's Android signing requirements](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/android/).

## Publish a test download

1. Complete the [release gate](build-and-test.md#full-stack-e2e-release-gate) and
   merge the reviewed change to protected `main`.
2. Open **Actions → Client installers → Run workflow**. Run from `main` and choose the `next` destination for
   `api.next.aven.ceo` or `production` for `api.aven.ceo`. Both use `aven.id`.
3. Wait for both desktop jobs and Android. The publish job refuses a missing,
   stale, unexpected, or incorrectly formatted installer. It publishes only
   after all build jobs and package checks pass.
4. Open **Releases**, choose the new **test installers** prerelease, and download
   the package matching your operating system and architecture. Read its signing
   limitations before installing. Compare its SHA-256 with `SHA256SUMS`.

Use the releases listing for these prereleases; GitHub's `/releases/latest` link
selects stable releases and does not select a test prerelease. Existing source-only
releases remain unchanged. Intel Mac and iOS installers are not part of this workflow.

The only repository secret read by these builds is `PACKAGE_READ_TOKEN`, through
the shared temporary registry-authentication step. No deployment Environment or
server credentials are used. The publishing job alone receives `contents: write`.
Every build checks out the workflow's exact commit, uses frozen JavaScript dependencies
and locked Cargo dependencies, and selects deployment origins explicitly.
Before any native build starts, the workflow audits the JavaScript lockfile again
against current advisories. A source that passed promotion earlier can still be
blocked by a newly reported vulnerability; update it through the normal PR and
promotion checks before publishing.

## Retry and verification

If building fails, rerun the failed jobs of the same workflow. No public release is
created until all installers exist. If uploading fails, the release remains a draft;
retry accepts only a draft naming the same source commit. It never replaces an
already published release. A new workflow run creates a new version.

When Linux verification fails, `diagnostic-linux-packages` retains the built DEB
and AppImage in the workflow's artifacts for one day so the exact failing package
can be reproduced. These are unverified diagnostic files. The publisher only
downloads `client-*` artifacts from successful jobs and cannot include them.

The required platform gate also builds and verifies the Linux packages in parallel
with its other checks, before promotion. It uses version `0.0.0-next.1` only for
verification and never publishes those files. Failed gate packages are retained
for one day as `diagnostic-linux-package-check`.

Both paths use `scripts/setup-client-linux.sh` for the Ubuntu dependencies and
tauri-driver 2.0.6, then `scripts/verify-client-linux.sh` for package verification.
The smoke test starts a private D-Bus session inside its virtual display so desktop
services inherit the correct display. It keeps the normal startup deadline and
fresh application profile. Extraction checks use a temporary directory that is
removed after verification.

Package verification checks Linux architecture and runtime contents, launches the
AppImage with a fresh profile to verify WebKit and the native sign-in screen, checks the Mac disk
image and the application signature inside its read-only mounted contents, and Android signature, alignment, minimum SDK,
ABI, package name, and version code. The normal full-stack E2E checks the Linux
client's account, document, invoice, and chat flows; it does not establish macOS or
Android runtime compatibility. Those platforms still need native smoke testing.

## Local packaging

On a prepared native build host, install frozen dependencies and run from the root:

```bash
CLIENT_RELEASE_VERSION=26.9.7-next.1 \
CLIENT_ANDROID_VERSION_CODE=30000001 \
AVEN_API_BASE_URL=https://api.next.aven.ceo \
bun scripts/build-client-release.ts linux-x64
```

Use `macos-arm64` on an Apple Silicon Mac with Xcode 16.4 selected. The native
passkey bridge requires Swift tools 6.1; Xcode 15.4's Swift 5.10 cannot build it.
CI uses `macos-15` and explicitly selects Xcode 16.4 before Rust compilation,
rather than relying on the runner's default Xcode.
For `android-arm64`, use Linux x64 with
JDK 17, Android SDK 36, NDK `27.2.12479018`, and the `aarch64-linux-android` Rust target.
Set `JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME`, and `NDK_HOME` to those installations. Output is
`dist/client-release/`. The build removes only its platform's previous bundle output
before collecting new files; it does not remove application data.

The version values above are local examples, not a published release identity. The
workflow supplies a unique version and monotonically increasing Android version code.
