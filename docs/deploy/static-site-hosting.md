# Static-site hosting

## Boundary

Static hosting is a platform capability, not an identity or checkout feature:

```text
aven.ceo Rust app -> api.aven.ceo -> hosting control store
                                      |
                                      v
                               static-site-host -> public GitHub
                                      |
                                      v
                                Caddy -> site
```

The installed `aven.ceo` Rust application owns the management UI. It obtains
a short-lived, passkey-qualified token from `aven.id` and calls the fixed
`api.aven.ceo` origin from Rust. Neither `aven.id` nor `my.aven.ceo`
contains site-management pages or routes.

The facade owns the small `site_bindings` control table. The static host has no
database, Caddy-admin, Hetzner, identity-signing, or DNS-provider credential. It
polls a private bearer-protected directory and reports reconciliation status.
Caddy's on-demand TLS ask endpoint admits only a currently active exact hostname.

## Repository contract

Each site uses a public GitHub repository with:

- a source branch such as `main`;
- a generated deployment branch such as `deploy/main`;
- `dist/index.html` on the deployment branch; and
- `dist/.source-revision` containing the exact 40-character source commit SHA.

Only `owner/repository` identifiers are accepted. Clone URLs are derived by
the service, not supplied by callers. A failed fetch, invalid source/artifact
pair, or invalid DNS response never replaces the last-known-good release.

## User-managed sites

In the installed app, open **Settings -> Static Hosting** and provide the
hostname, repository, source branch, and deployment branch. The Rust host calls:

```http
POST https://api.aven.ceo/api/sites
Authorization: Bearer <short-lived aven.id JWT>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "hostname": "www.customer.example",
  "repository": "owner/repository",
  "sourceBranch": "main",
  "deploymentBranch": "deploy/main"
}
```

The response includes a one-time DNS token. Create exactly the returned records:

```text
_aven-site.www.customer.example  TXT  <one-time token>
www.customer.example             A    <returned platform IPv4>
www.customer.example             AAAA <each returned platform IPv6, if present>
```

The database stores only the SHA-256 token hash. Every resolved A and AAAA value
must be in the deployment allowlist; mixed or CDN address sets fail closed.
Editing a binding rotates the token and returns it to `awaiting_dns`. Deleting
it withdraws Caddy authorization without affecting any other binding.

The authenticated facade endpoints are:

- `GET /api/sites`
- `POST /api/sites`
- `PUT /api/sites/:id`
- `DELETE /api/sites/:id`

Ownership is checked against the verified `aven.id` subject on every
mutation. Callers cannot create `aven.ceo` or its subdomains; those names are
reserved for system-managed configuration.

## The `aven.ceo` system site

The platform deployment seeds `aven.ceo` from `SYSTEM_SITES_JSON`:

```json
[
  {
    "hostname": "aven.ceo",
    "repository": "myavenceo/aven-brands",
    "sourceBranch": "production",
    "deploymentBranch": "deploy/production"
  }
]
```

System sites use operator verification, cannot be edited through the user API,
and are visible only to an authenticated administrator in the Rust UI. The
infrastructure workflow changes apex DNS only when its explicit **Move aven.ceo
DNS** input is enabled.

## Runtime configuration

The platform Compose stack receives generated secrets and Pulumi outputs:

- `SITE_HOST_DIRECTORY_BEARER_TOKEN`: generated 32-128 character service
  credential shared only by the facade and static host;
- `SITE_HOST_PUBLIC_IPV4` / `SITE_HOST_PUBLIC_IPV6`: addresses returned to
  users and admitted during DNS verification;
- `SITE_HOST_POLL_SECONDS`: defaults to 60;
- `SITE_HOST_DNS_GRACE_SECONDS`: defaults to 86400 for a previously verified
  site;
- `SITE_HOST_MAX_FILES`: defaults to 10000;
- `SITE_HOST_MAX_BYTES`: defaults to 268435456;
- `SITE_HOST_MAX_CONCURRENT_SYNCS`: defaults to 4; and
- `SYSTEM_SITES_JSON`: operator-owned site declarations.

Persistent releases and the last-known-good managed state live in
`/var/lib/aven/static-sites` on the protected platform volume.

## Verification

The local platform E2E automatically verifies authenticated CRUD, ownership,
reserved-host rejection, forged identity-header stripping, private-directory
authentication, a real shallow fetch of the `aven-brands` production and
`deploy/production` branches, source-revision matching, and HTTP serving.

After publishing the shared site:

1. confirm the binding is `active` in the Rust application;
2. compare its active source and artifact revisions with GitHub;
3. request the homepage and an SPA fallback path over HTTPS;
4. confirm `/internal/*` and unknown hosts return 404; and
5. restart Caddy and `static-site-host` while the facade is unavailable, then
   confirm the active site still serves from persisted managed state.

For host creation, initial apex publication, recovery, and all required secrets, follow
the authoritative [deployment handbook](../operations/deployment.md).
