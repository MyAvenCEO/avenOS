/**
 * The one primitive. Everything above this file is composition.
 *
 * An actor is an id, a manifest, private state, and handlers — the classic
 * Hewitt shape, Abject-flavored (abject.world), local-only. Two ideas carried
 * over deliberately:
 *
 * - **Messaging is the design surface.** Actors interact only through
 *   envelopes on the bus; the model's tool calls, the UI's clicks and (later)
 *   other machines are just different senders.
 * - **ask() is the one LLM-touching handler.** Every actor can be interviewed
 *   in natural language and answers *as itself*, from its own manifest and
 *   state. Ordinary messages stay deterministic. Without an LLM available the
 *   answer degrades to manifest prose — the cheap answer, never no answer.
 *
 * Contracts are Prolog-flavored: methods (and the actor itself) declare
 * `requires` / `produces` predicates like `work(M, Spark)`. Nothing is wired
 * by hand — the flow graph is DERIVED by unifying produces against requires
 * ("compression, not abstraction": a stored flow template would freeze a
 * judgment; the derivation regenerates with the registry).
