 * The model as a service actor (0130, straight from the abject rule: "the

 *
 * Every completion in the mesh is a MESSAGE to this actor — ask() answers,
 * llm-actor execution, all of it. The transport it wraps is the single
 * client of the server proxy (/api/chat, the TEE lane), so model ids,
 * temperature clamps and JSON mode have exactly one home. The bus derives
 * its lane from this actor — no ambient model function exists anymore.
 *
 * The mailbox serializes completions like any actor's messages — the
 * actor-model guarantee, accepted deliberately over parallel calls.

 * Host-side ride-alongs on the lane settings. They travel ONLY between host
 * functions (cap impl → dispatch payload → transport) — never through the
 * sandbox membrane and never into a request body: the transport picks them
